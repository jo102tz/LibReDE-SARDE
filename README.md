This is the repository for the Self-adaptive Resource Demand Estimation (SARDE) framework. SARDE enables continuous resource demand estimations, while constantly adapting and optimizing its used estimators.
SARDE is designed as an AddOn to the classic [LibReDE](http://descartes.tools/librede) libary. 
Therefore, the project name `librede-rrde` stands for Reliable Resource Demand Estimation AddOn for LibReDE.
